# Imputation for predictive analytics (`ipa`)

The goal of `ipa` is to make imputation in predictive modeling workflows
more straightforward and efficient. The main functions in `ipa` are

1.  `brew` Create a container to hold your imputations

2.  `spice` (optional) set parameters that govern the number of
    imputations for the given brew

3.  `mash` fit models that will provide imputations

4.  `ferment` impute missing values in training and (optionally) testing
    data

5.  `bottle` output the imputed datasets in a tibble.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of ipa from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- install.packages("ipa") -->

<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version of `ipa` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bcjaeger/ipa")
```

# Example: diabetes data

These data are courtesy of Dr John Schorling, Department of Medicine,
University of Virginia School of Medicine. The data originally described
1046 participants who were interviewed in a study to understand the
prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and other cardiovascular risk factors
in central Virginia for African Americans. A total of 403 participants
were screened for diabetes, which was defined as glycosolated hemoglobin
\> 7.0. Among those 403 participants, 366 provided complete data for the
variables in these data.

First, weâ€™ll load some packages and set a seed for reproducibility

``` r

library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)
library(ipa)

data("diabetes", package = 'ipa')

diab_complete <- diabetes$complete
diab_missing <- diabetes$missing

glimpse(diab_missing)

## K-nearest-neighbor imputation

K-nearest-neighbors (KNN) is a flexible and useful method for imputation
of missing data. Briefly, each missing value is imputed by aggregating
or randomly sampling a value from the K observations with greatest
similarity to the current obervation. Conventional methods for KNN
provide imputations using a single value of K, which makes it hard to
identify an optimal value of K. Ideally, one would generate imputed
datasets using a number of different values of K, and then use whichever
K provided the most accurate imputed values or the most accurate
prediction model (usually, these K are the same or similar). This is one
of the things `ipa` does.

Generally, the `ipa` workflow follows the same patterned steps. Here is
an example of this workflow using k-nearest-neighbors. A more detailed
explanation of the steps below is written in the `Getting started`
vignette.

``` r

nbrs_brew <- brew_nbrs(diab_missing, outcome = diabetes) %>%
  verbose_on(level = 1) %>% # makes the brew noisy
  spice(with = spicer_nbrs(k_neighbors = 1:35)) %>% # tuning parameters
  mash() %>% # creates imputed values 
  ferment() %>% # turns values into a data frame
  bottle(type = 'tibble') # turns data into tibbles, adds outcome column
#> Imputing chol, N observed = 227
#> Imputing stable_glucose, N observed = 226
#> Imputing hdl, N observed = 223
#> Imputing age, N observed = 231
#> Imputing gender, N observed = 235
#> Imputing frame, N observed = 227
#> Imputing sbp, N observed = 228
#> Imputing dbp, N observed = 227
#> Imputing waist, N observed = 211
#> Imputing hip, N observed = 223
#> Imputing time_ppn, N observed = 236
#> Imputing height_cm, N observed = 221
#> Imputing weight_kg, N observed = 243
