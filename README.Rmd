The 5 steps of brewing beer and conducting imputation for predictive analytics (IPA):

1. **malt** 

Determine the type of wheat and prepare it for mashing. 

Determine the type of imputation method and prepare it for use.

2. **mash**

The malted wheat is paired with hot or boiling water. 

The imputation method is paired with relevant parameters.

3. **boil**

Hops and spices are added to the wort and boiled, creating flavors for enjoyment.

Training data is added to the analysis and imputed, creating models for imputation of testing data with missing values.

4. **ferment**

Yeast is added to the mixture as a catalyst. The flavors in the wort interact with the yeast and create alcohol.

Data (training or testing) is added to the analysis. The imputation models interact with the data and create sets of complete (intoxicating) data.


5. **bottle**

The mixture is stored in bottles and aged. After this step, the brew is ready to be enjoyed!

The observed and imputed values are stored in lists and formatted as single/multiple/stacked data. After this step, the data are ready to be enjoyed (i.e., used to develop predictive models)!
